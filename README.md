The reason I'm making this portfolio website of mine is because I want to have something that can showcase my skills and passion towards employers and clients so that I become more outstanding in terms of impression towards them.

I believe that with the initiation of this portfolio site, I'll be a more competitive person in the tech field and can learn new stuff in the process.

I hope this website will be a successful project that I'm proud of and eager to show to everyone!
